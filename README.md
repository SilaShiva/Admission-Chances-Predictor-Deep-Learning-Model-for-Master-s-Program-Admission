# Admission-Chances-Predictor-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Master-s-Program-Admission

**Introduction:**
In today's rapidly evolving world, pursuing higher education has become increasingly competitive. With the surge in the number of applicants for Master's programs, it's crucial for students to gauge their chances of admission accurately. The Admission Chances Predictor leverages deep learning techniques to forecast the likelihood of acceptance into the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) based on various applicant profiles.

**Dataset Overview:**
The dataset used for this project comprises essential parameters considered during the admission process:

GRE Scores
TOEFL Scores
University Rating
Strength of Statement of Purpose
Strength of Letter of Recommendation
Undergraduate GPA
Research Experience
Chance of Admit

**Purpose:**
The primary goal of this project is to assist prospective students in evaluating their chances of admission to UCLA's Master's programs. By analyzing historical admission data, our deep learning model provides insights to aid students in making informed decisions about their university applications.

**How to Use:**
Dataset Preparation: Ensure your data is formatted similarly to the provided dataset.
Model Training: Utilize the provided scripts to train the deep learning model on your dataset.
Prediction: After training, input your profile details into the model to receive an estimation of your chances of admission.

**Dependencies:**
